# Pretty Qualtrics 💅🏻

Currently, Qualtrics offers a suite of layouts with predefined styles and JS-triggered behaviors that support particular UI designs. Of these, my personal favorite (and, indeed, the recommended layout) is the "Simple" layout. However, this format is currently limited in functionality for particular questions. Here, I have reverse-engineered the front-end through custom CSS and JS to reproduce the visual and experiential elements of this design by redesigning the "Flat" layout.
